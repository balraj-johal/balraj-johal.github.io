This is my personal portfolio website built with the MERN stack, publically hosted at www.balraj.cool

## Project Workflow
- The website was initially designed in Figma: LINK

## Project Choices
- Redux is likely overkill for state managememt, but I chose to use it as it's being used in my professional work contracts and I decided to use it here to gain more familiarity and experience with the library.
- The project was originally hosted on GitHub pages when it was a static site, however it is now deployed through Heroku. Heroku was chosen for ease of deployment.

## Next Steps 
- Better project management: Kanban Task Management, better Git Workflow through use of branches/pull-requests
- Create CRUD API for easy editing/updating of portfolio entries
- Consider learning alternative methods of state/data management
- Implement React Test Library

## WARNING: Some graphical artifacts have been observed on iOS browsers.
