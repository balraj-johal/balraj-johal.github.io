This is my personal portfolio website built with the MERN stack, publically hosted at www.balraj.cool

## Project Choices
- Redux is likely overkill for state management, but I chose to use it due to familiarity and experience with the library.
- The project is hosted on Heroku, for ease of Continuous Deployment

## Next Steps 
- Create CRUD API for easy editing/updating of portfolio entries
- Implement React Test Library

## WARNING: Some graphical artifacts have been observed on iOS browsers.
