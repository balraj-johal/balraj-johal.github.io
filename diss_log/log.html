    <H2>Important Decisions made recently (19/02/19)</H2>
    <p>Visual Recognition chosen as the most important Watson service to use,
        as it adds a lot more value than the others. It can augment puzzles in
        a really cool way.

        Markerless AR was desired so as to remove the need for physical placement of markers, which comes with a ton of barriers (legality, having to physically be there), but discarded primarily due to WebGL being incompatible with ARCore and ARKit. Web compatibility was the primary concern, to allow for the smoothest user epxerience possible and to make the dev easy. Also Marker based AR can allow for greater puzzle complexity, as markerless AR isn't very feature rich. 

        AR.js chosen (why?).

        Issues ran into as of today: AR.js test doesn't recongnise Hiro marker.
                                     Watson shit v confusing.
